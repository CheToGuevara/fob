2003-00-00 libfob 1.0.1
 - Time to sleep between sending commands over the RS232 cable to 
   the flock hardware can now be specified in fob::fob and
   fob::open.  The default is 500ms.
 - Added fob::set_sleep, fob::get_sleep.
 - Reworked the flock initialization code in fob::open to work on
   more systems.
 - Added fob::set_error_level.  If the hardware flags an error less that
   the level specified to set_error_level, then the hardware error is
   ignored.  The default level is fob::FATAL.
 - fob::check_error now will set a descriptive hardware error message
   when a hardware error is detected.
 - Button support didn't quite work in the last version.  It
   fully works now.
